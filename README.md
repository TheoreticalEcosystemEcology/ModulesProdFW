# How is ecosystem functioning affected by modules in fodd webs

Lab members involved: Tim Poisot (lead) & Dom Gravel   
Other people involved: Dan Stouffer (?)

## Synopsis

We assembled a large dataset of 137 binary food webs. For each we counted the frequency of 3-species motifs (community modules). Each food web is simulated using a classical and well parameterized model of food web dynamics, with and without allometric scaling, and the resulting functioning is recorded. We use an ANOVA approach to find out which modules influence functioning, and how.
